Further Modified by Weiwei He, 2023/2025
% Updates by Weiwei He:
% - 2023/2025: introduced improved section layouts and citation formatting.
% - 2023/2025: added support for Angstrom symbol, chemical formulas, list of appendix, and advanced table formatting (three-part tables, split cells, and diagonal lines).
% **The key update in this 2025 version is the added support for a "List of Appendices" page before the main thesis body, a feature required by NYU but not available in the 2021 version.**

How to use:
- The `thesis.tex` file is the main file for the thesis.
- Add your own macros and additional latex packages to `defs.tex`.
-
