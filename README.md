NYU PhD dissertation template complying with the [official formatting guidelines](https://gsas.nyu.edu/content/dam/nyu-as/gsas/documents/dissertationsubmissionrelated/A%20Formatting%20Guide%20(UPDATING%2010-09-15).pdf) of Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (as of 2007,2019,2021,2023/2025).

This is based on a template by Jos√© Koiller (2007-2008). Modified by Siddharth Krishna, 2019. Revised by Quynh M Nguyen, 2021. Further modified by Weiwei He, 2025.

### Updates in 2025 version:
- Introduced improved section layouts and citation formatting.
- Added support for Angstrom symbols, chemical formulas, list of appendices, and advanced table formatting (three-part tables, split cells, and diagonal lines).
- The key update in this version template is the added support for a **"List of Appendices"** page before the main thesis body (see compiledpdf.pdf), a feature required by NYU.
- This version also includes several bug fixes in `thesis.tex` and `refs.tex` for improved functionality and compliance.

The new template is also available on [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/new-york-university-phd-dissertation-template-gsas-approved-2025/mgygzvtnjdyn).
